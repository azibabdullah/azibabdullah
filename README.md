# Hi there! 👋  

I’m Abdullah, a Computer Science student passionate about Cybersecurity and AI.  
I’m obsessed with understanding how systems work, how they break, and how to secure them.

These days I’m focused on:

- Cybersecurity & Network Security fundamentals
- Learning LLM's vulnerabilities and how to secure them
- Linux and system-level understanding  
- AI-assisted learning and automation  
- Building security-focused and low-level projects

Some stuff I work on:

- Networking simulations using Cisco Packet Tracer  
- System-level programming in C++  
- Web-based projects with PHP & MySQL
- Full-Stack projects with Django and RESTFUL-API's
- Exploring ethical hacking concepts and tools  
- AI-driven workflows for faster learning

Fun Facts:

- I’m deeply curious about how things work under the hood  
- I prefer solving problems over small talk  
- Mission: Become a Cyber & Network Security Specialist 🔐
